- ba244d3 Add stage2 loader + build raw disk image

What changed
- Stage-1 boot sector now loads a stage-2 payload from disk sector 2 (INT 13h) and jumps to 0x0000:0x1000.
- Added stage-2 program that prints a message + halts.
- Makefile now builds build/os.img (boot sector + stage2 padded to 512B) and runs it via QEMU.
- Added daily log for 2026-02-06 and refreshed README.

Notes
- Local build still fails here if nasm/qemu aren't installed ("nasm: No such file or directory").

What's next (suggested)
- Add keyboard input (INT 16h) + minimal prompt/echo loop in stage2.
- Grow stage2 beyond 1 sector (stage1 reads multiple sectors; consider LBA or simple contiguous loader).

Push status
- Pushed to origin/main successfully.
