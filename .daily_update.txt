- 2d15a28 Add minimal x86 boot sector + Makefile

What changed
- Added a 512-byte x86 boot sector (src/boot.asm) that prints "os-2week: boot ok" via BIOS INT 10h and halts.
- Added Makefile + .gitignore; updated README with build/run commands.
- Logged the day in daily/2026-02-05.md.

Notes
- Build tooling isn’t installed on this host yet (make currently fails with: nasm: No such file or directory). QEMU also not present here.

What’s next
- Decide stage-2 loader vs. flat kernel approach.
- Add documented/reproducible toolchain setup (apt packages or Docker) so builds can run anywhere.

Push status
- Pushed to origin/main successfully.
