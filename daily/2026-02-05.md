# 2026-02-05

## What I did
- Added a minimal 512-byte x86 boot sector (`src/boot.asm`) that prints a message via BIOS INT 10h and halts.
- Added a simple `Makefile` and `.gitignore`.
- Updated README with build/run commands.

## Notes / blockers
- This machine currently doesn't have the x86 toolchain pieces installed (`nasm`, `qemu-system-i386`), so `make` fails here with `nasm: No such file or directory`.

## Next
- Decide on the “day 2” target: add a tiny stage-2 loader (still real mode) or switch to a flat kernel build (i386-elf gcc/clang + linker script).
- Add a documented toolchain setup path (apt packages or a pinned Docker image) so builds are reproducible.
