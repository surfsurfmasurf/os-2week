## Progress
- Added `v` (version) command to the stage2 shell.
- Minor refactor of string storage in `stage2.asm`.
- Version reported: `v0.1.0`.

## Notes
- Building out single-character commands first to verify dispatch logic.
- Still plan to implement buffered input for real command strings next.
