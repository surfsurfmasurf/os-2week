## Progress
- Implemented a primitive shell loop in `stage2.asm`.
- Added character echo for input.
- Added basic commands:
    - `r`: Warm reboot (INT 19h).
    - `q`: Halt the system.

## Notes
- The shell currently only handles single-character triggers.
- Next step: Buffer input strings and implement a real command parser.
