## What I did
- Converted the project from a single boot sector into a tiny 2-stage boot flow:
  - **Stage 1** (`src/boot.asm`): prints a message, reads **sector 2** from the boot disk via BIOS INT 13h, then jumps to `0x0000:0x1000`.
  - **Stage 2** (`src/stage2.asm`): prints a message and halts.
- Updated the `Makefile` to build a raw disk image (`build/os.img`) containing the boot sector + stage2 (padded to 1 sector).
- Updated README to describe the new layout.

## Notes / blockers
- If we expand stage2 beyond 1 sector, stage1 will need to read multiple sectors (and eventually move to LBA reads or a simple filesystem / contiguous loader).

## Next
- Add basic keyboard input (INT 16h) and a minimal “prompt” loop in stage2.
- Add a tiny print-hex routine + diagnostics (show boot drive, read status codes).
