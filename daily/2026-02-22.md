# Day 17: PCI Bus Enumeration

## Tasks
- [x] Implement `pci` command in Stage 2 shell.
- [x] Basic PCI scanning of Bus 0 via Port 0xCF8/0xCFC.
- [x] Display Vendor ID and Device ID for found devices.

## Details
The `pci` command iterates through all 32 possible devices on PCI Bus 0 and checks for a valid Vendor ID. If found, it prints the Bus:Device.Function and the ID pair.

## Next Steps
- Protected Mode transition (finally).
- Basic FAT12 filesystem support for loading files.
