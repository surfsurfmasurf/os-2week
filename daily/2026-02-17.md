- Implemented `date` command using RTC ports (0x07, 0x08, 0x09).
- Implemented `color` command to change text attribute (modifies `bl` in BIOS TTY output).
- Added `hex_to_bin` helper for color parsing.
- Updated `ver` and `help` commands.
- Refactored `print_string` to use a global `text_attr` variable.

Next: File system exploration or basic memory allocator.
