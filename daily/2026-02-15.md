# Daily Log: 2026-02-15

## Progress
- Implemented `uptime` command in `src/stage2.asm`.
- Accesses BIOS timer tick counter at `0040:006C`.
- Added `print_decimal_32` helper for numeric output.
- Updated `ver` and `help` commands.

## Challenges
- `nasm` is not installed on the current host, so binary builds cannot be verified locally, but code logic follows standard x86 real mode conventions.

## Next Steps
- Transition to Protected Mode (GDT setup).
- Basic IDT for hardware interrupts.
