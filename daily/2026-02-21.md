## Summary
Added the `poke` command to the Stage 2 shell. This allows direct modification of 16-bit real-mode memory by specifying a 4-digit hex address and a 2-digit hex value.

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Implementation of `parse_hex_byte` helper for 2-digit hex parsing.
- [x] Addition of `cmd_poke` string and `.do_poke` handler in `src/stage2.asm`.
- [x] Updated `help` and `ver` command output.
- [x] Verified build stability with `make`.

## Technical Details
- Command syntax: `poke <4-digit-hex> <2-digit-hex>` (e.g., `poke 0500 FF`)
- This completes the basic memory inspection/manipulation toolkit (`dump`, `peek`, `poke`).

## Next Steps
- Consider a `load` command to load small binary payloads to memory.
- Transition to Protected Mode (Day 3 milestone cleanup/refinement).
