## Task: Memory Inspection Tools
Added `peek` command to the shell to allow inspecting single bytes of memory at a specific hex address. This complements the `dump` command added yesterday.

## Changes:
- Modified `src/stage2.asm`:
  - Added `cmd_peek` string.
  - Added `msg_peek_help` string.
  - Implemented `.do_peek` logic using `parse_hex_word`.
  - Updated `help` command message.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` to reflect progress.

## What's Next:
Consider adding a `poke` command to write values to memory, or start exploring basic filesystem structures (FAT12).
